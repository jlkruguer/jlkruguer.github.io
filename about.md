Hello! I’m Jordan. I’m a Data Scientist and Researcher.

I currently work at Kairos Aerospace where we are tackling methane emissions.  I'm driven by the challege of combating climate change and using technology and strategy to create a more sustainable society and have worked at early and growth stage startups related to those goals. 

More stuff about me: I have a degree in Applied Mathenatics from Harvard. I'm from Maine. And in my spare time I like to do outdoor research () and spend time making things ().
