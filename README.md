Hello! I'm Jordan. I'm a data scientist and researcher.

I currently work at [Kairos Aerospace](https://kairosaerospace.com/) where we are working to reduce GHG emissions by finding the largest methane emission sources quickly and efficiently.

I'm passionate about applying analytical methods and machine learning to develop systems and solutions that improve the sustainability, health, and experiences of communities and individuals. To that end, I have pursued work across a variety of domains from climate and sustainable cities to neuroscience and digital humanities. 


More stuff about me: I have a degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard. I'm from Maine. I love spending my time outdoors across New England with my wife, dog, and friends.
