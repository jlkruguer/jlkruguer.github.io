Hello! I'm Jordan. I'm a Data Scientist & ML Engineer with 4+ years of experience at early and growth stage startups.

I currently work as the Director of Machine Learning at [Blue Voice](https://bluevoice.io/) where we are building closed loop AI tools for first responders. 

I'm passionate about applying analytical methods and machine learning to develop systems and solutions that improve the sustainability, health, and experiences of communities and individuals. To that end, I have completed work and projects across a variety of domains. Some other areas I've worked and completed projects in include:
- Detecting methane, wild fires, minerals, etc. from space using Hyperspectral Satellites
- Detecting methane from fixed wing aircraft and designing reduction strategies using simulation and modeling 
- Conducting analyses on economic and urban development in cities in North America and Europe
- Building interaction systems for museum exhibits
- Decoding neural signals in motor control

More stuff about me: I have a degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard. I'm from Maine. I love spending my time outdoors across New England with my wife, dog, and friends.
