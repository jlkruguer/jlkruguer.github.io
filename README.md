Hello! I'm Jordan. I'm a Data Scientist & ML Engineer with 4+ years of experience at early and growth stage startups.

I currently work as an ML Engineer at [Orbital Sidekick](https://www.orbitalsidekick.com/) where we are developing machine learning models on hypserspectral data, delivering spectral intelligence for problems in methane emissions, mining exploration, wild fire mitigation, and much more. My work focuses on taking methods from research in remote sensing, adapting and improving them for use with data from our unique hyperspectral constellation, and creating robust and performant end-to-end machine learning pipelines to deliver automated intelligence to our customers. 

I'm passionate about applying analytical methods and machine learning to develop systems and solutions that improve the sustainability, health, and experiences of communities and individuals. To that end, I have completed work and projects across a variety of domains from remote sensing and climate to sustainable urban planning, neuroscience and digital humanities. 

More stuff about me: I have a degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard. I'm from Maine. I love spending my time outdoors across New England with my wife, dog, and friends.
